    <h3 class="sectionHeading">About Me</h3>
    <div class="aboutMe">
      Hello! <br />
      I'm a software engineer with around two years of industry experience.
      <br />
      <p class="aboutMeInner">
        To describe myself simply: <br />
        I am not a perfect programmer but
        <strong>I am a hard working one.</strong> <br />
      </p>
      When I'm working on a project I don't settle for something lackluster.
      While I'm certainly not perfect, I always try to create something that I
      can be proud of. If I do say so myself, I consider myself above average. I
      take great joy in looking at a finished project and thinking "that looks
      good".<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I have plans for this website. Check back in some other time to see if
      I've expanded it!

            <a target="_blank" href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> is
            currently my choice framework for mobile app development.
            <br />
            It's powerful, well-suported and lends itself well to the philosophy
            of letting the developer control the architecture. I find it to be
            quite unopinionated as far as frameworks go and I can prototype apps
            in it very quickly.

            As of right now,
            <a target="_blank" href="https://nestjs.com/">NestJS</a> is my
            favourite backend JS framework.<br />
            The documentation is made to get you going
            <strong>now</strong> with as little friction as possible. Parts of
            it are inspired by Angular and I often joke that NestJS explains
            Angular better than the actual Angular documentation! While I can't
            call myself an expert in it, I have used it on multiple smaller
            projects.

            Most of my current job revolves around

              >Dotnet. </a
            ><br />
            I use ASP.NET for API development and Blazor for frontend
            development. I have spent months at this point grinding on systems
            that are built on Dotnet and C# and feel very comfortable with it.

            We did heavy C++ programming during our studies at university.<br />
            Recently I haven't used it as much, since I'm mostly focused on web
            development. I still try to keep up with it from time to time, as I
            enjoy lower-level programming.

            When I have a choice I much prefer using Linux over Windows, having
            found that it's a much more inviting and developer-friendly
            environment. I've gotten used to it over the last few years and I'm
            always looking to sharpen my 'Unix skills', since there's still
            <strong>a lot</strong> I don't know or understand. I also have
            experience using the Unix-based MacOS.

            knowledge stems from my study of machine learning.<br />
            I've learned quite a bit of python while working on neural networks
            in <a target="_blank" href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> and
            I've grown relatively accustomed to the 'python way' though I seldom
            use Python for things like API development.

            While I have started to gain a feeling for the language, I am still
            very far from proficiency. Since I've decided to try and learn it,
            I've found that using it is a frustrating but very educational
            experience.

            containerisation. In particular I've used Docker Compose on several
            occasions. I have not used it extensively but I have started to
            understand its philosophy:<br />Having to manually keep track of
            several different parts of a system (api, db, messaging queue....)
            can become frustrating and error prone. Deploying everything 'under
            one roof' in a Docker Compose is much neater.

            I do have experience using Java, mostly during my studies.<br> I find 
            that it's very nice for making portable code (all you need is a JVM 
            to run it after all) but it's never actually come up during my work in industry. <br>
            I have a ton of experience with similar languages like C# and Dart, so I don't feel too out of place with Java.
